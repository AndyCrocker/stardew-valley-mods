# Custom Crafting Stations

Custom Crafting Stations (CCS) is a framework mod that allows modders to create specialized cooking and stations. These stations can be attached to a BigCraftable object, or to tiledata.

Recipes from these stations can be excluded from non-custom cooking/crafting menus, allowing access to recipes to be limited to only the custom crafting station.
